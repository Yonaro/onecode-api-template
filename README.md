Template created for Onecode projects.
This api template uses the following:

  - Hapi.js
  - Sequelize
  - Sequelize -auto : for autmatic model scaffolding based on an existing database.
  - Nodemon
  
  The purpose for the creation of this template is to have a good fast starting point for creating and mainting REST api's. 
  
  This is a dynamic template and will be continiouslly improved. It's not perfect, but I'm the most productive using the current structure.
